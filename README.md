# Drexel_STAR_Research_Project
Computational modeling of classical conditioning in fruit flies using cybernetic automata. This project simulates first- and second-order learning protocols, replicating behavioral experiments in neuroscience to explore memory, decision-making, and adaptive feedback systems.
